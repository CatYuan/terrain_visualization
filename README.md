# terrain_visualization

-	Created a 3d surface mesh using topographic data from a structured DEM, digital elevation model, using the PyVista Python interface.
-	Generated a computationally faster coarser mesh and visualized the error between the bilinearly interpolated elevation of the coarsened mesh and the original.
